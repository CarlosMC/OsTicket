This is my first Github repository AND first repository ever so patience is a virtue for anyone committing to this project or using the software.
osTicket Reloaded is an osTicket which supports several localizations or languages.
Developers, who would like to contribute to make this osTicket fork successful are more than welcome to join osTicket Reloaded to make this for the best multilingual osTicket fork ever!

This for is based on OsTicket fork from Carlos Delfino (admin@full.srv.br - http://www.full.srv.br) Version1.6 RC5 and now is based on new work on Version 1.6 ST.
